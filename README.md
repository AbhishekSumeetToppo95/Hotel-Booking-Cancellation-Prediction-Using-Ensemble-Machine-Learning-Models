# Hotel-Booking-Cancellation-Prediction-Using-Ensemble-Machine-Learning-Models

•Developed and evaluated predictive classification models to forecast hotel booking cancellations, leveraging
Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and Logistic Regression; achieved up to 86.7% ROC AUC
after model tuning and resampling.
• Addressed severe class imbalance using techniques like class weighting and resampling, significantly
improving recall and precision for the minority class, which increased the model’s practical usability in
real-world scenarios.
• Engineered categorical and temporal features (e.g., month, market segment, customer type) and applied
one-hot encoding and feature transformation to prepare data for training.
• Utilized RandomizedSearchCV for efficient hyperparameter optimization, enhancing model performance
while preventing overfitting.
• Assessed model performance using multiple evaluation metrics including precision, recall, F1-score, and
ROC AUC; created comprehensive model comparison reports to support model interpretability and
selection.
